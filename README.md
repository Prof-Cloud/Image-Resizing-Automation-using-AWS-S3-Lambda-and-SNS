# Image-Resizing-Automation-using-AWS-S3-Lambda-and-SNS

In this project, I built a fully serverless, automatic image processing system that resizes images as soon as they're uploaded to an S3 bucket. As soon as the file gets dropped off, AWS Lambda takes over and shrinks the image to a preset size, uploads the resized image to a different S3 bucket and then sends an email notification through SNS. =
